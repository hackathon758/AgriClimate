# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(2) ENHANCED RESPONSES: Updated fallback prompts to generate more detailed answers with practical examples, seasonal trends, typical price ranges, regional variations, best practices, and government schemes. (3) HYBRID MODE: Added generate_hybrid_answer() that combines partial live data with AI knowledge when limited data is available (threshold: <5 records). Uses clear section markers to distinguish live data from AI knowledge. (4) FALLBACK SOURCES: Added TRUSTED_SOURCES dictionary with 15+ trusted government/research websites (Agmarknet, IMD, Ministry of Agriculture, ICAR, etc.). get_relevant_sources() method intelligently selects top 5 relevant sources based on query topic. Sources now returned in all fallback and hybrid responses. Backend restarted successfully. Ready for comprehensive testing."

    message: "Fixed the main bug causing 'unable to fetch data' error. Root cause was that search_datasets function was too restrictive and only matched very specific keywords like 'crop', 'rain', 'agriculture'. When users asked about 'rice', 'wheat', 'price', 'potato', etc., it returned 0 datasets. Additionally, KNOWN_DATASETS had incorrect information - 2 out of 3 dataset IDs were invalid. Fixed by: 1) Updating KNOWN_DATASETS with correct information, 2) Vastly expanding keywords_map to include price-related terms, specific crops, and Hindi equivalents, 3) Adding fallback to return all datasets if no match, 4) Adding comprehensive logging.
